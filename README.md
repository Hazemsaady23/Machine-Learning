# 🎮 Video Game Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📊 Project Overview
This project predicts **global video game sales** based on attributes like **platform, genre, year, and publisher** using multiple regression models.  
It compares performance across **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to determine which algorithm best captures sales patterns.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess the [Video Game Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)
- Train and evaluate three regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Compare model performance using RMSE and R² scores
- Visualize sales trends by genre, platform, and region
